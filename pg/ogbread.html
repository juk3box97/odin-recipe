        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (25-ounce) package Parkerhouse Roll Dough 
                    (such as Bridgford), thawed</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1Â½ teaspoons garlic salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Roll each dough piece into an 8-inch stick, and place 
                on the prepared baking sheets. Brush sticks with about 
                half of the melted butter. Let rise in a warm place 
                (80 to 85 degrees F (26 to 29 degrees C)), free from 
                drafts, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake breadsticks in the preheated oven until breadseticks 
                are lightly golden, about 10 minutes, rotating pan 
                halfway through. Brush with remaining melted butter, and 
                sprinkle with garlic salt. Serve warm.</li>
