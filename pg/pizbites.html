    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head cauliflower, cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>⅓ cup pizza sauce</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Line a muffin tin with parchment paper squares.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Grate cauliflower into a microwave-safe bowl 
                using a fine grater. Chop any remaining pieces 
                too small to grate and add to the bowl.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Cook in the microwave until cauliflower is soft 
                and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour into a clean 
                dish towel and let cool enough to handle, 15 to 
                20 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Wrap the towel around cauliflower and squeeze 
                out as much liquid as possible; the drier, 
                the better.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Combine squeezed cauliflower, 1 cup mozzarella 
                cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, salt, pepper, garlic 
                powder, and onion powder in a large bowl until well
                combined. Scoop evenly into the prepared muffin cups. 
                Pat down cauliflower mixture with the back of a spoon, 
                making it compact.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 
                about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and spoon pizza 
                sauce evenly onto each crust. Top with remaining 1 1/2 
                cups mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and 
                golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let pizza bites sit in 
                the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to 
                cool for 10 minutes. Remove parchment paper from the 
                bottoms and arrange bites on a platter.
            </li>
        </ol>
