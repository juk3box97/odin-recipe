# odin-recipe
The current project is recipe page. It is teaching how to use anchors, image sourcing, and lists to create a purely HTML based website, to later be spruced up with the custimization of CSS. I learned quite a bit, and have been getting a lot more confident with HTML.


3 versions, I updated after each page of the website was finished. minor change in between v1 and v2 
was adding the extra spaces in between the ordered steps of the directions.
